Comments from Xiangni:

For SimulationAG1AG2PoissonGLM_Weighted_Gradient:
Gradient clipping was not implemented in the version we discussed during Tuesdayâ€™s meeting. The current version has been updated to include both clipped gradients and weighted gradients. In addition, comparisons between the weighted and unweighted gradient cases are included in the file. (The unweighted gradient under equal sample sizes was applied to verify that the two functions produce consistent results, making sure that the application of the weighted gradient is correct.)
